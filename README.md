## ✨ Project Highlights

* **Immersive 3D Scroll-Link:** Leverages **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber (R3F)** for high-fidelity 3D scene rendering, tightly synchronized with native browser scroll using **GSAP's ScrollTrigger**.
* **Next.js 14 Performance:** Built on Next.js 14's **App Router** for optimized build times and server-side rendering benefits, ensuring fast loading and SEO.
* **Decoupled Content Management:** Utilizes **Prismic** as a Headless CMS, separating content from the presentation layer for easy updates.
* **Type-Safe Development:** Developed entirely with **TypeScript**, ensuring code reliability across the integration of GSAP, R3F, and Prismic.
